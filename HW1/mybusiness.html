              <p>Welcome. Luna Piao, <img src="IMG_5750.jpg" alt="ME" />president and founder of Luna's&reg; Coffee. I am a full-time student of the University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in Financial Actuarial Mathematics and pursuing a Specialization in Computing. From a year ago, I have been running this company while studying mathematics and computer programming courses at UCLA to earn some extra income to cover my college expenses.</p>
				
            
				
	     <p>Drinking coffee have always been my favorite activity of all. Living in Los Angeles for the past five years, I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to taste many different types of coffee. Some were from specialty coffee shops, some were from local coffee shops. I wanted to make my own coffee in my own coffee shop. I wanted to make a type of coffee that is different from all other coffee in the world. After months of experimentation, I finally found that a custom blend of three coffee beans from three different countries would make the coffee taste one-of-a-kind and unforgettable. I would love to share this extraordinary new coffee with every coffee lover in our community!</p>
